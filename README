Instructions
	Print a small test part to verify fitment.
	There is 0 tolerance between the panels to ensuire a strong friction fit.
	The panels should require significant force to fit together (requiring a hammer) and should also not crack when assembled.
	When using the hammer, apply many light taps to mechanically (and slowly) slide them together without causing damage.
	Use one piece of printer paper between the hammer and the panels to minimize dirt transfer and changes to the surface finish.
	I noticed my ABS filament on my printer has some warp after cooling, but the impact was minor since the assembled panel can still flex.
		Delaminating the parts from the bed, then annealing each side could potentially reduce or eliminate this warp. This is untested.
	Notes
		The original 4 x M5x10 BHCS and DIN rails work with this new 5mm thick deck panel. No additional hardware is required.
		The electronics and z motor drives need to be removed to install the current version
		The teardown and installation can be done without disconnecting most of the electronics on a 2.4r1 but the process can be a bit messy.
